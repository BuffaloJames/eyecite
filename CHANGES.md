# Change Log

## Current

2.0.2 - Adds missing dependency to toml file, nukes setup.py and 
requirements.txt. We're now fully in the poetry world.

## Past

2.0.1 - Major rewrite to efficiently build and use hundreds of regular
expressions to parse the text, and to use merging algorithms to annotate it.
These changes bring better speed, accuracy, and flexibility to the library.

2.0.0 - Broken, bad release process.

1.1.0 - Standardize the `__eq__()` and `__hash__()` methods and remove the
unused fuzzy_hash() method.

0.0.1 - Initial release with CL-compatible API.

0.0.1 to 0.0.5 - Continuous deployment debugging
