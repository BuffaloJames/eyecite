Blah blah Foo v. Bar 1 U.S. 1, 77 blah blah. Asdf asdf Qwerty v. Uiop 2 F.3d 2, 555. Also check out Foo, 1 U.S. at 99. Then let's cite Qwerty, supra, at 666. See also Foo, supra, at 101 as well. Another full citation is Lorem v. Ipsum 1 U. S. 50. Quoting Qwerty, “something something”, 2 F.3d 2, at 559. This case is similar to Fake, supra, and Qwerty supra, as well. This should resolve to the foregoing. Ibid. This should also convert appropriately, see Id., at 577. This should fail to resolve because the reporter and citation is ambiguous, 1 U. S., at 51. However, this should succeed, Lorem, 1 U.S., at 52.
