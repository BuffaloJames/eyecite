## Developer Guide: How to Update eyecite
Here are the steps a developer should take to integrate these new citation types into the eyecite library.

### 1. Set Up a Development Environment
First, fork the eyecite repository on GitHub. Clone your fork locally and create a new branch for these features (e.g., feature/expanded-parsers). Follow the instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md to install dependencies and run the existing test suite to ensure everything is working.

### 2. Locate and Review tokenizers.py
The heart of eyecite's parsing logic is in the eyecite/tokenizers.py file. This file contains the various Tokenizer classes, each responsible for finding a specific type of citation. Familiarize yourself with how these classes are structured.

### 3. Create New Tokenizer Classes
For each new category of citation (e.g., Regulations, Constitutions, Journals, Scientific Identifiers), create a new class in tokenizers.py. It should inherit from one of the base tokenizer classes.

Example JournalTokenizer Structure:

Python

import re
from eyecite.tokenizers.base import BaseTokenizer

class JournalTokenizer(BaseTokenizer):
    """Tokenizer for law review and journal articles."""
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        # Compile the universal regex pattern
        self.regex = re.compile(
            r"(?P<volume>\d+)\s+(?P<reporter>[\w\s.&;']+?)\s+(?P<page>\d+)"
            r"(?:,\s+(?P<pincite>[\d-]+))?\s+\((?P<year>\d{4})\)",
            re.IGNORECASE,
        )

    def find_all_citations(self, text: str):
        # Logic to find all matches in the text
        for match in self.regex.finditer(text):
            # Here you would create and 'yield' a JournalCitation object
            # This part requires creating a corresponding model in eyecite/models.py
            yield self.make_citation_from_match(match)

### 4. Combine Regex Patterns
For categories with many variations (like state statutes or regulations), combine all the individual regex strings into a single, large pattern using the | (OR) operator. Place more specific patterns (like Georgia's constitutional format) before more general ones to ensure they are matched correctly.

### 5. Integrate New Tokenizers into the Pipeline
eyecite has a main function or class that orchestrates which tokenizers are run on a piece of text. You must add instances of your new tokenizer classes to this pipeline so they are actually used. Look for a list or dictionary of tokenizers in the main eyecite module.

### 6. Add New Citation Models (If Necessary)
If a citation type is entirely new (like a JournalCitation or PatentCitation), you may need to add a corresponding data model class in eyecite/models.py. This class defines the data structure for the parsed citation (e.g., fields for volume, reporter, page, etc.).

### 7. Write Comprehensive Tests
This is a critical step. For every new regex pattern you add, create a corresponding test case in the tests/ directory.

Create a new test file (e.g., tests/test_journals.py).

Write tests with examples that should match to confirm the regex works.

Write tests with examples that should not match to prevent false positives.

Add tests for edge cases (e.g., extra whitespace, unusual numbering).

### 8. Submit a Pull Request
Once all your new tokenizers are implemented and all tests are passing, commit your changes, push the branch to your fork, and open a Pull Request to the main freelawproject/eyecite repository. In the description, clearly explain the new features you've added and reference your extensive list of supported formats.

# Comprehensive Citation Formats for eyecite
This document outlines the regex patterns and logic needed to significantly expand eyecite's parsing capabilities across various legal and scientific citation types.

## 1. General Enhancements
This logic should be applied to the relevant existing tokenizers to improve functionality.

Citation Ranges: To properly handle ranges like §§ 13-18, the regex for any tokenizer that uses a section symbol should be modified to match one or two symbols.

Find: §

Replace with: §{1,2}

Range Post-processing: After a range is matched, the tokenizer should be modified to yield two separate citation objects: one for the start of the range and one for the end.

## 2. Statutory Citations
Patterns for codified laws. The full 50-state list has been generated; this is a representative sample.

Federal (U.S. Code):

Format: 15 U.S.C. § 13

Regex: (?P<title_num>\d+)\s+U\.S\.C\.\s+§\s+(?P<section_num>[\w\d-]+)

## 3. Administrative Regulations
Patterns for federal and state regulatory codes.

Federal (Code of Federal Regulations):

Format: 42 C.F.R. § 438.6

Regex: (?P<title_num>\d+)\s+C\.F\.R\.\s+§\s+(?P<section_num>[\d.]+)

Format: U.S. CONST. art. I, § 9, cl. 2

Regex: U\.S\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[IVXLCDM]+),\s§\s(?P<section>\d+)(?:,\scl\.\s(?P<clause>\d+))?

Federal (Amendments):

Format: U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1

Regex: U\.S\.\sCONST\.\samend\.\s(?P<amendment>[IVXLCDM]+)(?:,\s§\s(?P<section>\d+))?

Standard State Pattern:

Format: VA. CONST. art. IV, § 14

Georgia (Specific Variation):

Format: GA. CONST. art. I, § 1, para. I.

Regex: Ga\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\w\d]+),\s§\s(?P<section>[\w\d]+),\spara\.\s(?P<paragraph>[\w\d]+)

## 5. Court Rules
Patterns for federal and state court rules.

Regex: Va\.\sSup\.\sCt\.\sR\.\s(?P<rule_num>[\d:]+)

## 6. Legislation (Uncodified)
Patterns for bills and session laws.

Federal Bill (House):

Format: H.R. 25, 118th Cong. (2023)

Regex: H\.R\.\s(?P<bill_num>\d+),\s(?P<congress_num>\d+)th\sCong\.

Federal Session Law (Statutes at Large):

Format: Pub. L. No. 94-579, 90 Stat. 2743

Regex: Pub\.\sL\.\sNo\.\s(?P<law_num>[\d-]+),\s(?:§\s(?P<section_num>[\d\w-]+),)?\s(?P<volume_num>\d+)\sStat\.\s(?P<page_num>[\d,\s]+)

Generic State Session Law:

Format: [year] [State] Acts [number]

Example Regex (Va.): (?P<year>\d{4})\sVa\.\sActs\s(?P<chapter_num>[\d\w-]+)

## 7. Scientific & Academic Identifiers
Patterns for common academic, scientific, and technical identifiers.

You can extend eyecite to handle these identifiers by adding new tokenizers with specific regex patterns.

Detect the Identifier: Create new regex patterns to find DOIs and PMIDs in text.

DOI Regex: \b(10\.\d{4,9}/[-._;()/:A-Z0-9]+)\b

PubMed ID Regex: \bPMID:\s*(\d+)\b

Extract and Enrich:

Modify eyecite to use these patterns to find and extract the identifiers.

The application using eyecite would then take the extracted ID.

Based on the ID type (DOI or PMID), it would make a background API call to the appropriate service (Crossref or NCBI).

Use the Metadata: The application receives the JSON data and can use it to provide users with rich information about the cited article, such as displaying a full citation, linking to the article online, or showing an abstract.

### DOI (Digital Object Identifier):

Regex: \b(10\.\d{4,9}/[-._;()/:A-Z0-9]+)\b

A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a persistent identifier used to uniquely identify electronic documents. The Crossref API is the official and most comprehensive way to resolve them.

It's a simple, open REST API that returns detailed information in a JSON format.

How to Use: You construct a URL by appending the DOI to the API endpoint.

API Endpoint: https://api.crossref.org/works/{DOI}

Example: To look up the DOI for the classic Watson and Crick paper on DNA structure (10.1038/171737a0), you would use this URL:

https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1038/171737a0

The API will return a JSON object containing rich metadata, including the full title, authors, journal name, publication date, and more.

## ⚕️ For PubMed IDs: The NCBI Entrez API
A PubMed ID (PMID) is a unique integer value assigned to each article indexed in PubMed, the primary database for biomedical and life sciences literature. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides a powerful set of tools called Entrez E-utilities to access this data.

Regex: \bPMID:\s*(\d+)\b

The Entrez API is a bit more complex, using URL parameters to specify the database and desired information.

How to Use: You use the esummary utility to fetch the document summary for a given ID.

API Endpoint: https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi

Example: To look up the paper with PMID 6145023, you would construct this URL:

https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=6145023&retmode=json

This returns a JSON object with the article's title, author list, journal name (source), publication date, and other details.

### Other research IDs
ISBN (International Standard Book Number):

Regex: ISBN(?:-13)?:\s*?(97[89](?:-|\s)?\d(?:-|\s)?\d{3}(?:-|\s)?\d{5}(?:-|\s)?\d)

arXiv ID:

Regex: arXiv:(\d{4}\.\d{4,5}(?:v\d+)?)

SSRN ID:

Regex: SSRN\s*(\d{6,})

NCT Number (ClinicalTrials.gov):

Regex: \b(NCT\d{8})\b

U.S. Patent Number:

Regex: U\.S\.\s(?:Patent|Pat\.\sApp\.)\sNo\.\s([\d,/-]+)

CAS Registry Number:

Regex: CAS\s(?:No\.?|Number)\s(\d{2,7}-\d{2}-\d)

ORCID iD:

Regex: \b(\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{3}[\dX])\b

## Law Journal Articles (Universal Pattern):

Regex: (?P<volume>\d+)\s+(?P<reporter>[\w\s.&;']+?)\s+(?P<page>\d+)(?:,\s+(?P<pincite>[\d-]+))?\s+\((?P<year>\d{4})\)

### The Core Citation Structure
Regardless of the journal's name, the core of a citation almost always follows the same pattern: a volume number, the abbreviated journal title, and a page number, followed by the year in parentheses.

The author's name and the article's title, which come before this core, are typically just plain text and are very difficult to capture reliably. Therefore, the regex focuses on the unique part of the citation shown above.

### The Universal Regex Pattern ✍️
This single pattern is designed to be robust enough to capture the vast majority of law review and journal article citations you'll encounter.

Code snippet

(?P<volume>\d+)\s+(?P<reporter>[\w\s.&;']+?)\s+(?P<page>\d+)(?:,\s+(?P<pincite>[\d-]+))?\s+\((?P<year>\d{4})\)
## How It Works
This regex identifies a journal citation by looking for its key structural components:

(?P<volume>\d+): This captures the volume number that always starts the citation.

\s+: Matches the space after the volume.

(?P<reporter>[\w\s.&;']+?): This is the flexible part that captures the abbreviated journal name. It looks for any combination of letters, numbers, spaces, periods, ampersands, and other common characters. The ? makes it "non-greedy," so it stops matching as soon as it sees the numbers of the page.

\s+: Matches the space before the page number.

(?P<page>\d+): Captures the starting page number.

(?:,\s+(?P<pincite>[\d-]+))?: This is an optional group that captures any pincite (a reference to a specific page or range of pages) that might follow the starting page number.

\s+\((?P<year>\d{4})\): This captures the four-digit year, which must be enclosed in parentheses.

### Journal Examples in Action
Here’s how this single pattern would correctly parse a variety of journal citations:

For: 133 Harv. L. Rev. 845, 848 (2020)

Volume: 133

Reporter: Harv. L. Rev.

Page: 845

Pincite: 848

Year: 2020

For: 125 Yale L.J. 250 (2015)

Volume: 125

Reporter: Yale L.J.

Page: 250

Pincite: (none)

Year: 2015

For: 68 Am. J. Comp. L. 1 (2020)

Volume: 68

Reporter: Am. J. Comp. L.

Page: 1

Pincite: (none)

Year: 2020

Integrating this robust pattern into eyecite will provide excellent coverage for the thousands of different journals cited in legal documents.

## Legislation

I didn't include them in the last list for a specific reason: state bill citations are one of the least standardized areas of legal citation, making a comprehensive, state-by-state list like we did for statutes or court rules extremely difficult.

### The Challenge with State Bills
Unlike the highly regular formats for federal bills (H.R. 123) or state session laws (2025 Va. Acts 45), the way states cite their pending or unenacted bills varies dramatically. Formats can differ between the House and Senate within the same state, and they often change with each legislative session.

The "Bluebook" PDFs reflect this lack of uniformity, often giving only general guidance rather than a specific format for each state's bills. Creating a precise regex for every state is often impractical due to the high risk of errors.

### A Generic Regex Pattern for State Bills
However, we can create a generalized regex pattern designed to capture the most common structures for state bills. This pattern looks for the key components that most state bill citations share.

Common Format: [State Abbr.] [Bill Type] [Bill #], [Session Info] ([Year])

Example: Va. H.B. 145, 118th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (2025)

Generic Regex: (?P<state_abbr>[A-Z]{2,4}\.\s)?(?P<bill_type>H\.B\.|S\.B\.|A\.B\.|H\.F\.|S\.F\.)\s(?P<bill_num>\d+)(?:,\s(?P<session_info>[\w\s\d.-]+))?\s\((?P<year>\d{4})\)

How This Regex Works:
(?P<state_abbr>[A-Z]{2,4}\.\s)?: Optionally captures a state abbreviation.

(?P<bill_type>H\.B\.|S\.B\.|A\.B\.|H\.F\.|S\.F\.): Captures the most common bill type abbreviations (House Bill, Senate Bill, Assembly Bill, House File, Senate File).

(?P<bill_num>\d+): Captures the bill number.

(?:,\s(?P<session_info>[\w\s\d.-]+))?: Optionally captures the legislative session information.

\((?P<year>\d{4})\): Captures the four-digit year.

### Important Caveats
While this generic pattern is a good starting point, it comes with significant trade-offs:

It Will Miss Variations: It won't capture the unique formats used by many states that don't conform to this structure.

Potential for False Positives: Because it's flexible, it might occasionally match text that isn't a bill citation.

For truly comprehensive coverage, the best approach would be to identify the specific states you are most interested in. We could then research their exact bill citation formats and create the more precise, tailored regex patterns you've requested for other categories.

## More legislation
This category includes unenacted bills (like H.R. 25) and session laws (the chronological publication of laws passed by a legislature, like Pub. L. No. 94-579). These are distinct from the codified statutes (like the U.S.C.) that we have already covered.

Adding these patterns will significantly enhance eyecite's ability to parse documents discussing the legislative process.

### 📄 Federal Legislation
Federal legislation is highly standardized, with specific formats for bills from each chamber of Congress and for the official session laws.

House of Representatives Bills

Format: H.R. [bill number], [congress number]th Cong. (year)

Example: H.R. 25, 118th Cong. (2023)

Regex: H\.R\.\s(?P<bill_num>\d+),\s(?P<congress_num>\d+)th\sCong\.

Senate Bills

Format: S. [bill number], [congress number]th Cong. (year)

Example: S. 123, 118th Cong. (2023)

Regex: S\.\s(?P<bill_num>\d+),\s(?P<congress_num>\d+)th\sCong\.

Federal Session Laws (Statutes at Large)

This is for laws that have been enacted but not yet codified in the U.S. Code.

Format: Pub. L. No. [public law number], § [section], [volume] Stat. [page] (year)

Example: Pub. L. No. 94-579, § 102, 90 Stat. 2743, 2744 (1976)

Regex: Pub\.\sL\.\sNo\.\s(?P<law_num>[\d-]+),\s(?:§\s(?P<section_num>[\d\w-]+),)?\s(?P<volume_num>\d+)\sStat\.\s(?P<page_num>[\d,\s]+)

# Court Rules
Parsing court rules is complex due to the wide variety of abbreviations. To ensure the highest accuracy for eyecite, I have created a specific regex for each jurisdiction rather than relying on a single generalized pattern.

## ⚖️ Federal Court Rules
Federal court rules are standardized and widely cited. It's best to use a distinct regex for each major set of rules.

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

Format: FED. R. CIV. P. [rule number]

Example: FED. R. CIV. P. 56

Regex: Fed\.\sR\.\sCiv\.\sP\.\s(?P<rule_num>[\w\d.()-]+)

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

Format: FED. R. CRIM. P. [rule number]

Example: FED. R. CRIM. P. 16

# Constitutions

# Federal Constitution (U.S. CONST.)
Citations to the U.S. Constitution come in two main forms: one for the main body (articles, sections, and clauses) and one for the amendments. It's best to use two separate regex patterns to capture them accurately.

Main Body (Articles & Clauses)

This pattern identifies citations to the original articles of the Constitution.

Format: U.S. CONST. art. I, § 9, cl. 2

Regex: U\.S\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[IVXLCDM]+),\s§\s(?P<section>\d+)(?:,\scl\.\s(?P<clause>\d+))?

Amendments

This pattern identifies citations to the amendments.

Format: U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1

Regex: U\.S\.\sCONST\.\samend\.\s(?P<amendment>[IVXLCDM]+)(?:,\s§\s(?P<section>\d+))?

## State Constitutions
State constitutional citations follow a general structure: the state's abbreviation, the word "CONST.", and then the specific article and section numbers. This generalized regex is designed to capture that common format across different states.

General Pattern

This pattern identifies the state abbreviation and the most common structural elements.

Format Examples: VA. CONST. art. IV, § 14 or CAL. CONST. art. I, § 7

Regex: (?P<state_abbr>[A-Z][A-Za-z]{1,3}\.)\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\w\d]+)(?:,\s§\s(?P<section>[\d\w]+))?

This single pattern should successfully parse the majority of state constitutional citations you'll encounter. These regex snippets can now be added as a new citation type within the eyecite library.

## The Standard Pattern (Covers Most States)
First, here is a single, robust regex that will correctly parse citations for the approximately 45+ states that follow the standard Bluebook format.

Format: [State Abbr.] CONST. art. [article #], § [section #]

Example: VA. CONST. art. IV, § 14

Regex: (?P<state_abbr>(?:[A-Z]\.){2,}|[A-Z][a-z]+\.)\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\w\d]+)(?:,\s§\s(?P<section>[\d\w]+))?

Note: This pattern is designed to be flexible, capturing various state abbreviations (e.g., N.Y. or Cal.) and handling optional section numbers.

## 📜 State-Specific Formats
Based on the rules in your documents, the following states have unique constitutional citation structures that benefit from a specific regex pattern.

Georgia (Ga.)
Georgia's constitution includes paragraphs (para.), which is a unique subdivision.

Format: GA. CONST. art. I, § 1, para. I.

Regex: Ga\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\w\d]+),\s§\s(?P<section>[\w\d]+),\spara\.\s(?P<paragraph>[\w\d]+)

Maine (Me.)
Maine's constitution is subdivided into parts (pt.) within articles.

Format: ME. CONST. art. IV, pt. 3, § 1

Regex: Me\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\w\d]+),\spt\.\s(?P<part>[\d\w]+),\s§\s(?P<section>[\d\w]+)

Massachusetts (Mass.)
Massachusetts citations lead with the part (pt.), which contains articles that function like sections.

Format: MASS. CONST. pt. 1, art. 12

Regex: Mass\.\sCONST\.\spt\.\s(?P<part>\d+),\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\d\w]+)

New Hampshire (N.H.)
Similar to Massachusetts, New Hampshire's constitution is cited by part and article.

Format: N.H. CONST. pt. 1, art. 2

Regex: N\.H\.\sCONST\.\spt\.\s(?P<part>\d+),\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\d\w]+)

## Implementation for eyecite
To implement this for maximum accuracy in eyecite, you would use all of these patterns. The most efficient way is to combine them into a single, large regex using the | (OR) operator, placing the most specific patterns (the state-specific ones) first.

Example of a Combined Pattern:
(?:[Georgia Regex]|[Maine Regex]|[Massachusetts Regex]|[New Hampshire Regex]|[Standard Pattern Regex])

This structure ensures that when eyecite scans text, it first tries to match the unique state formats before falling back on the general pattern that covers the rest.

## Comprehensive Regex for eyecite
This document contains a compiled list of regular expressions for parsing various legal citations. It is intended to be a living document for improving the eyecite library.

## General Improvements
These are general pattern enhancements that should be applied to the appropriate tokenizers.

Handling Section Ranges: To capture ranges denoted by §§, the part of the regex that matches the section symbol should be changed from § to §{1,2}.

Post-processing for Ranges: When a range like §§ 13-18 is matched, the tokenizer should be modified to yield two separate citations for the start (§ 13) and end (§ 18) of the range.

## 1. Administrative Regulations 🏛️
This is the biggest and most impactful category. Both federal and state governments produce a vast amount of regulatory law, each with its own citation format.

Federal Regulations (C.F.R.): The Code of Federal Regulations is the codified body of federal rules.

Format: [title number] C.F.R. § [part].[section] (year)

Example: 40 C.F.R. § 704.25 (2023)

Federal Register (Fed. Reg.): The daily publication for new and proposed federal rules.

Format: [volume] Fed. Reg. [page] (date)

Example: 88 Fed. Reg. 13,793 (Mar. 6, 2023)

State Administrative Codes: Each state has its own version, with widely varying formats.

Example (N.Y.): N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 9, § 427.2 (2022)

Challenge: The sheer variety of state administrative code formats makes this a difficult but high-value target.

## 2. Constitutions 📜
While fundamental, constitutional citations have a unique, simple structure that may not be captured by the existing case or statute parsers.

Format: [U.S. or State Abbr.] CONST. art. [article], § [section], cl. [clause]

U.S. Example: U.S. CONST. art. I, § 9, cl. 2

State Example: VA. CONST. art. IV, § 14

Challenge: The roman numerals and specific abbreviations (art., cl.) require a dedicated regex pattern.

## 3. Court Rules ⚖️
Citations to the rules governing court proceedings are common in legal writing, especially in motions and briefs.

Federal Rules: The most common are the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Criminal Procedure, and Evidence.

Format: FED. R. CIV. P. [rule number]

Example: FED. R. CIV. P. 56

State Court Rules: Each state has its own set of procedural rules.

Example (Cal.): CAL. R. CT. 3.110

Challenge: The main difficulty is compiling the many different abbreviations for federal and state court rules.

## 4. Legislative History Documents 📄
These documents are crucial for statutory interpretation but have complex and varied citation formats. This would be a very advanced feature for eyecite.

Federal Bills (Unenacted):

Example: H.R. 25, 118th Cong. (2023)

Committee Reports:

Example: H.R. REP. NO. 118-22, at 5 (2023)

Congressional Hearings:

Example: Hearing on H.R. 25 Before the Subcomm. on XYZ of the H. Comm. on ABC, 118th Cong. 15 (2023) (statement of John Smith)

Challenge: These citations often mix formal identifiers with descriptive text, making them extremely difficult to parse with regular expressions alone.

## 5. Treaties and International Agreements 🌐
For legal work involving international law, identifying these citations is essential.

Format: [Agreement Name], [parties], [date signed], [treaty source]

Example: Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, Sept. 10, 1996, S. TREATY DOC. NO. 105-28, 35 I.L.M. 1439


# Multiple Statutory Sections (Or the double section symbol)
If the section symbol appears twice, that usually indicates a string or sequence of statutes. For example, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13-18 means 15 USC 13 through 15 USC 18. It would be too complicated to try and identify all of the citations in between 15 USC 13 and 15 USC 18. So, when we see the section symbol twice in a row, can we identify the first and last citation in the string? You can also see this explained in the section on scattered statutes.


 When eyecite encounters a citation with a double section symbol (§§) indicating a range, it can be modified to generate two distinct citations: one for the start of the range and one for the end.

This avoids the complexity of generating all intermediate citations while still capturing the full scope of the reference. This is a standard and highly effective way to handle "scattered statutes" in a parser.

The best way to implement this is with a two-step approach: first, use a specific regex to detect and capture the range, and second, use post-processing logic to create the two separate citation objects.

## The Two-Step Approach: Regex and Post-Processing
Regex Detection: We'll enhance the statutory citation regex to specifically look for the §§ symbol followed by a start number, a hyphen, and an end number. We can use named capture groups to cleanly extract the start and end values.

Post-Processing Logic: After the regex finds a match, the tokenizer's code will check if the start and end groups were captured. If they were, instead of creating one citation object, it will create and yield two: one using the start number and one using the end number.

## Practical Example: Code Implementation
Here is a simplified Python example demonstrating exactly how this logic would work.

Python

import re

# The text containing the citation range
text = "This is governed by 15 U.S.C. §§ 13-18, which is very important."

# A regex designed to capture the components of a range citation.
# Note the named capture groups ?P<start_num> and ?P<end_num>.
range_regex = re.compile(r"""
    (?P<volume>\d+)             # Capture the volume number (e.g., "15")
    \s+
    (?P<reporter>U\.S\.C\.)      # Capture the reporter name (e.g., "U.S.C.")
    \s+
    §§                          # Match the double section symbol literally
    \s*
    (?P<start_num>[\w\d.-]+)     # Capture the starting section number
    -                           # Match the hyphen separator
    (?P<end_num>[\w\d.-]+)       # Capture the ending section number
""", re.VERBOSE | re.IGNORECASE)

found_citations = []
match = range_regex.search(text)

# Post-processing logic
if match:
    parts = match.groupdict()
    
    # Construct the first citation string from the start of the range
    start_citation = f"{parts['volume']} {parts['reporter']} § {parts['start_num']}"
    found_citations.append(start_citation)
    
    # Construct the second citation string from the end of the range
    end_citation = f"{parts['volume']} {parts['reporter']} § {parts['end_num']}"
    found_citations.append(end_citation)

# Print the final result
print(found_citations)
Expected Output:
['15 U.S.C. § 13', '15 U.S.C. § 18']
## How to Integrate This into eyecite
This same logic can be directly integrated into the eyecite tokenizer. When the tokenizer's main regex loop gets a match corresponding to this new range pattern, its internal code would simply create and yield two separate StatuteCitation objects instead of the usual one. This is a very clean and efficient way to add this powerful feature.

# Parallel Citations
several states have parallel or multiple valid citation formats for their statutes. This complexity is exactly why automated tools like eyecite can find state statutes so challenging to parse.

The multiple forms usually arise from one of three situations:

Subject-Matter Codes: Instead of a single, unified code, the laws are organized into a collection of separate, topic-specific codes.

Official vs. Unofficial Compilations: One version is published by the state (official), while another, often more popular, annotated version is published commercially (unofficial).

Historical Versions: States periodically reorganize or "recompile" their laws, leading to old and new citation formats that may both appear in legal documents.

Here are some of the most prominent examples, many of which were noted in the documents you provided.

## States with Subject-Matter Codes
These states require a parser to recognize not just a single statutory title, but a variety of them.

Texas (Tex.): Texas has a large collection of separate codes organized by subject. A citation must include the name of the specific code.

Example 1: TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 12.34 (West 2021)

Example 2: TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. § 102.001 (West 2022)

California (Cal.): Like Texas, California's laws are split into numerous distinct codes.

Example 1: CAL. PENAL CODE § 187 (West 2020)

Example 2: CAL. CIV. PROC. CODE § 437c (West 2019)

New York (N.Y.): New York's collection of statutes is known as the "Consolidated Laws." Each subject is its own "Law."

Example 1: N.Y. PENAL LAW § 125.25 (McKinney 2021)

Example 2: N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4511 (McKinney 2022) (Civil Practice Law and Rules)

Maryland (Md.): Maryland is similar, but its subject-matter codes are called "articles."

Example: MD. CODE ANN., CRIM. LAW § 2-201 (West 2021)

## States with Official vs. Unofficial Compilations
In these cases, legal practitioners often prefer the commercially published unofficial versions because they include helpful annotations and cross-references.

Pennsylvania (Pa.): This is a classic example. Pennsylvania has an official compilation, but an older, commercially published version is still in wide use for un-consolidated statutes.

Official: 18 Pa. C.S. § 110 (2020) (Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes)

Unofficial: 71 P.S. § 732-101 (2019) (Purdon's Pennsylvania Statutes)

A comprehensive parser must be able to recognize both the Pa. C.S. and P.S. formats.

## Why This Matters for eyecite 📚
For your work improving eyecite, this means the regex for these states can't be a single, static pattern. It needs to be flexible. For example, the regex I created for Texas (Tex\.\s(?P<reporter>[\w\s&;]+?)\sCode\sAnn\.?\s§\s?(?P<section_num>[\d.]+)) uses a broad capture group (?P<reporter>[\w\s&;]+?) to capture the name of any subject-matter code it finds, making it much more robust.

## State-by-State Regex Snippets for Statutes
Here are the regex patterns for each state's primary statutory compilation, derived from your documents. They are designed to be added as alternatives (using the | pipe character) within the main statutory regex pattern in eyecite/tokenizers.py.

Each pattern uses named capture groups like (?P<title_num>\d+) for title numbers and (?P<section_num>[\d\w.-]+) for section numbers to make integration easier.

# Creating Single Regex for Each Citation Type
## Part 1: How to Create the Combined Regex String 🛠️
The goal is to take all the individual state-level patterns for a citation type (like Administrative Regulations) and merge them into one large, efficient pattern.

### Step 1: Gather and Prepare the Raw Regex Patterns
Collect all the individual regex strings for a single category (e.g., all 50 state administrative regulation patterns) and place them into a Python list.

Python

# Example for State Constitutions
raw_patterns = [
    r"Ga\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\w\d]+),\s§\s(?P<section>[\w\d]+),\spara\.\s(?P<paragraph>[\w\d]+)",  # Georgia
    r"Me\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article>[\w\d]+),\spt\.\s(?P<part>[\d\w]+),\s§\s(?P<section>[\d\w]+)",  # Maine
    # ... and so on for all other states
]
### Step 2: The Critical Problem: Duplicate Capture Group Names
You cannot simply join these patterns with a |. Python's re module will raise an error if a single regex pattern contains multiple capture groups with the same name. For example, if both the Georgia and Maine patterns use (?P<article>...), the combined regex will fail.

### Step 3: The Solution: Create Unique Capture Group Names
To solve this, you must modify each raw pattern to give its capture groups a unique name, typically by appending the state's abbreviation.

Before (Duplicate Names):

Georgia: (?P<article>...)

Maine: (?P<article>...)

After (Unique Names):

Georgia: (?P<article_ga>...)

Maine: (?P<article_me>...)

Here is the list from Step 1, now modified with unique names:

Python

# Note the unique names like 'article_ga' and 'article_me'
unique_patterns = [
    r"Ga\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article_ga>[\w\d]+),\s§\s(?P<section_ga>[\w\d]+),\spara\.\s(?P<paragraph_ga>[\w\d]+)",
    r"Me\.\sCONST\.\sart\.\s(?P<article_me>[\w\d]+),\spt\.\s(?P<part_me>[\d\w]+),\s§\s(?P<section_me>[\d\w]+)",
    # ... etc.
]
### Step 4: Programmatically Combine and Compile the Regex 🐍
Use Python to join the list of uniquely-named patterns into a single string. Then, compile it using the re.compile function for efficiency. The re.VERBOSE flag is highly recommended to allow for comments, and re.IGNORECASE is standard for citations.

Python

import re

# IMPORTANT: Place the most specific patterns (like Georgia's) at the
# beginning of the list to ensure they are matched first.
unique_patterns = [
    # ... list of all 50 uniquely-named state patterns ...
]

# Join all individual patterns with the '|' (OR) operator
combined_string = "|".join(unique_patterns)

# Compile the final regex object
# The outer (?:...) is a non-capturing group, which is good practice
COMPILED_REGEX = re.compile(
    f"(?:{combined_string})",
    re.IGNORECASE | re.VERBOSE,
)
The COMPILED_REGEX object is now ready to be used in eyecite.

## Part 2: How to Build This into eyecite
Once you have your compiled regex object, you need to integrate it into the eyecite library.

### Step 1: Create a New Tokenizer Class
In the file eyecite/tokenizers.py, create a new class for the citation category you're adding. This class will contain your combined regex.

Python

# In eyecite/tokenizers.py
from eyecite.tokenizers.base import BaseTokenizer

# Let's assume you've stored your compiled regex in a separate file
from .regex_patterns import STATE_CONSTITUTIONS_REGEX

class StateConstitutionTokenizer(BaseTokenizer):
    """Tokenizer for all U.S. state constitutions."""
    def __init__(, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.regex = STATE_CONSTITUTIONS_REGEX
### Step 2: Implement the Citation Finding Logic
The tokenizer needs to know what to do when it finds a match. This is handled in the find_all_citations method. The key is to check which of your uniquely named capture groups was successful.

Python

# Inside the StateConstitutionTokenizer class
    def find_all_citations(self, text: str):
        for match in self.regex.finditer(text):
            # The groupdict contains all named capture groups.
            # Unmatched groups will have a value of None.
            groups = match.groupdict()

            # Post-processing logic to determine which state was matched
            if groups.get("article_ga"):
                # It's a Georgia citation. Extract using the '_ga' groups.
                # Create a ConstitutionCitation object with the extracted data.
                citation = self.make_citation_from_match(match, groups, source="georgia")
                yield citation
            elif groups.get("article_me"):
                # It's a Maine citation. Extract using the '_me' groups.
                citation = self.make_citation_from_match(match, groups, source="maine")
                yield citation
            # ... add an elif block for every state pattern ...
### Step 3: Integrate the New Tokenizer into the Pipeline
eyecite has a central list of all the tokenizers it uses to scan text. You must add an instance of your new StateConstitutionTokenizer to this list. This is typically done in the main eyecite/__init__.py file or a similar central location.

### Step 4: Write Tests 🧪
This is the most important step to ensure correctness. In the tests/ directory, create a new file (e.g., tests/test_constitutions.py). For every single state pattern you added, write a test to confirm it correctly finds a citation.

Python

# In tests/test_constitutions.py
from eyecite import clean_text, get_citations

def test_find_georgia_constitution():
    text = "This is governed by Ga. Const. art. I, § 1, para. I."
    citations = get_citations(text)
    assert len(citations) == 1
    assert citations[0].metadata.article == "I"
    assert citations[0].metadata.paragraph == "I"
